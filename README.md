# 2016E Website SRC
Makes the client playable with this SRC.
# Modifying the SRC
You mostly need a private key. This can be changed in "game/qtkeylol5151515.pem".
Same as private key method, but you need to modifiy "GetAllowedSecurityVersions", and "GetAllowedMD5Hashes" to-
-match your client MD5, and version.
